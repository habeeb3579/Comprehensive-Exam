# Comprehensive-Exam
The code and data files for my comprehensive exam artifact centered on milk spectral data analysis using Chemometrics are available in this GitHub repository. The artifact comprises methods for feature selection and qualitative/quantitative analysis of spectral data using Chemometrics.


The repository consists of two main directories: "feature_selection" and "quantitative_analysis". The "feature_selection" directory contains the code files for feature selection techniques such as correlation-based feature selection (CFS), principal component analysis (PCA), and mutual information-based feature selection (MIFS). The code files are written in Python using the scikit-learn library. The "quantitative_analysis" directory contains the code files for chemometric analysis of spectral data. This includes data preprocessing, model building, and prediction using multivariate analysis techniques such as partial least squares (PLS) and principal component regression (PCR).

The repository does not include the dataset used because it is proprietary to Daisy Brand. The dataset contains cheese milk spectral data and the corresponding milk properties such as true protein, and casein content.
