# Comprehensive-Exam
The code and data files for my comprehensive exam artifact centered on milk spectral data analysis using Chemometrics are available in this GitHub repository. The artifact comprises methods for feature selection and qualitative/quantitative analysis of spectral data using Chemometrics.

The repository consists of a main directory: "milk analysis", which has a subdirectory "selection". The "selection" directory contains the code files for feature selection techniques such as PLS coefficients based Feature Selection, Interval Based PLS (iPLS), Backward Interval Based PLS (BiPLS), Synergy Interval Based PLS (SiPLS), Moving Window Based PLS (MWPLS), Simulated Annealing (SA). It also contains the 'Analysis' ipynb file which was used for the chemometric analysis. This includes data preprocessing, model building, and prediction using multivariate analysis techniques such as partial least squares (PLS), XGBoost, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The code files are written in Python using the scikit-learn library. 

The repository does not include the dataset used because it is proprietary to Daisy Brand. The dataset contains cheese milk spectral data and the corresponding milk properties such as true protein, and casein content.
